## Exercise 2 

The python script "Question2.py" is used to identify corrupt images in a folder. But the user reports that the script is running incorrectly, they are not sure what is causing the error. The folder they are running the script on is "Question_2_Images".
Given the python script and 1 sample corrupt image (indexed_5d5da9038aa716043cb777f4_0e2ee618-dab5-48c1-b13f-13ca3f8326e6.png), can you please diagnose what the error(s) are and fix the errors?
